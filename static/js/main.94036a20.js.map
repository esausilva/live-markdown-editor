A TextMarker is a\n\t// handle that can be used to clear or find a marked position in the\n\t// document. Line objects hold arrays (markedSpans) containing\n\t// {from, to, marker} object pointing to such marker objects, and\n\t// indicating that such a marker is present on that line. Multiple\n\t// lines may point to the same marker when it spans across lines.\n\t// The spans will have null for their from/to properties when the\n\t// marker continues beyond the start/end of the line. Markers have\n\t// links back to the lines they currently touch.\n\t\n\t// Collapsed markers have unique ids, in order to be able to order\n\t// them, which is needed for uniquely determining an outer marker\n\t// when they overlap (they may nest, but not partially overlap).\n\tvar nextMarkerId = 0;\n\t\n\tvar TextMarker = function(doc, type) {\n\t  this.lines = [];\n\t  this.type = type;\n\t  this.doc = doc;\n\t  this.id = ++nextMarkerId;\n\t};\n\t\n\t// Clear the marker.\n\tTextMarker.prototype.clear = function () {\n\t    var this$1 = this;\n\t\n\t  if (this.explicitlyCleared) { return }\n\t  var cm = this.doc.cm, withOp = cm && !cm.curOp;\n\t  if (withOp) { startOperation(cm); }\n\t  if (hasHandler(this, \"clear\")) {\n\t    var found = this.find();\n\t    if (found) { signalLater(this, \"clear\", found.from, found.to); }\n\t  }\n\t  var min = null, max = null;\n\t  for (var i = 0; i < this.lines.length; ++i) {\n\t    var line = this$1.lines[i];\n\t    var span = getMarkedSpanFor(line.markedSpans, this$1);\n\t    if (cm && !this$1.collapsed) { regLineChange(cm, lineNo(line), \"text\"); }\n\t    else if (cm) {\n\t      if (span.to != null) { max = lineNo(line); }\n\t      if (span.from != null) { min = lineNo(line); }\n\t    }\n\t    line.markedSpans = removeMarkedSpan(line.markedSpans, span);\n\t    if (span.from == null && this$1.collapsed && !lineIsHidden(this$1.doc, line) && cm)\n\t      { updateLineHeight(line, textHeight(cm.display)); }\n\t  }\n\t  if (cm && this.collapsed && !cm.options.lineWrapping) { for (var i$1 = 0; i$1 < this.lines.length; ++i$1) {\n\t    var visual = visualLine(this$1.lines[i$1]), len = lineLength(visual);\n\t    if (len > cm.display.maxLineLength) {\n\t      cm.display.maxLine = visual;\n\t      cm.display.maxLineLength = len;\n\t      cm.display.maxLineChanged = true;\n\t    }\n\t  } }\n\t\n\t  if (min != null && cm && this.collapsed) { regChange(cm, min, max + 1); }\n\t  this.lines.length = 0;\n\t  this.explicitlyCleared = true;\n\t  if (this.atomic && this.doc.cantEdit) {\n\t    this.doc.cantEdit = false;\n\t    if (cm) { reCheckSelection(cm.doc); }\n\t  }\n\t  if (cm) { signalLater(cm, \"markerCleared\", cm, this, min, max); }\n\t  if (withOp) { endOperation(cm); }\n\t  if (this.parent) { this.parent.clear(); }\n\t};\n\t\n\t// Find the position of the marker in the document.
